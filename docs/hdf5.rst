-  Hierarchical Data Format version 5, known as HDF5, is a general
   purpose file format that can store every kind of data in a
   hierarchical manner. An HDF5 file could be described by a tree of
   nodes. Each node could contain other nodes or leaves and described
   with attributes. Leaves under a specified node corresponds to stored
   data and could also have several attributes to describe them. This
   format is well adapted to scientific data because it allows to store
   images, tables, matrices and more with efficient I/O and compression
   options. That's why it has been chosen as a common file format to
   share data between FACETS members. `more

HDF5 and Python
---------------

In fact HDF5 is not only a file format. It's also a high level C++ API
that allows to store data in a such format. But it is not the only way
to store data in a HDF5 file. The pytables python library, makes easier
the conception of HDF5 files in an Object Oriented (OO) manner. It
enables files nodes tree navigation, nodes attributes affectation,
tables or arrays creation and data insertion. This library is really
mature and gives access to many practical functions, but it was
necessary to extend this library with new classes and functions to adapt
it to Optical Imaging and Neural Network Simulation contexts.

Why developping an extension ?
------------------------------

Developping an extension is an OO approach necessary to make itself
reusable, easily extendable and avoid the pytables code pollution.
Moreover, it allows to generate new objects classes that are easier to
recognize among base objects and gives access to new functionnalities
adapted to each object. A such extension requires that users and
developpers who want to work on it have a knowledge on pytables base
library. But a class (cf next paragraph) has been fortunately developped
to simplify access to pytables classes and function. It will replace old
hdf5tools and hdf5api in the
`NeuroTools </trac/NeuroTools/wiki/NeuroTools>`_ folder.

Extension Overview
------------------

This extension is divided in 5 Python files :

#. FileExtension? : the base class of the extension, inherits from the
   pytables File class. Could be considered as a high level library that
   gives access to all pytables objects and the new extension objects.
#. AdvancedTable? : add new functionnalities to the pytables Table class
   like sorts, insertions and queries on tables.
#. Images : useful to convert common file format to VLArray pytables
   class and display images embedded into HDF5.
#. Movie : encapsulate several common file format images located in a
   filesystem folder into a VLArray and display them.
#. Spikes, divided into 3 distincts classes :

   #. `SpikeList </trac/NeuroTools/wiki/SpikeList>`_ : store spikelist
      like [(reltime1, id1), ... (reltimeM, idM)]
   #. SpikingNeurons? : store spikelist like [[reltime1, id1, ...,
      idM],...,[reltimeK, ..., id N]]
   #. NeuronIndex? : store neuron index defined like [[id1, posX1,
      posY1, posZ1], ..., [idN, posXN, posYN, posZN]] or [[id1, posX1,
      posY1, layer1], ..., [idN, posXN, posYN, layerM]]
