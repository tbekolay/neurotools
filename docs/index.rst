NeuroTools
==========

NeuroTools is a collection of tools to support all tasks associated with
a neural simulation project and which are not handled by the simulation
engine. NeuroTools is written in Python, and works best with
`PyNN <http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN>`_, or one of the growing list of
simulation engines with a Python front-end such as
`NEURON <http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron>`_,
`NEST <http://www.nest-initiative.org/>`_,
`PCSIM <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pcsim/>`_, `FACETS Neuromorphic
VLSI <http://wwwasic.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/asicnew/vision/projects/facets/software_and_experiments/>`_,
`Brian <http://brian.di.ens.fr/>`_,
`MOOSE/GENESIS <http://moose.sourceforge.net/>`_,
`Neurospaces/GENESIS <http://neurospaces.sourceforge.net/>`_. NeuroTools
provides modules to facilitate simulation setup, parameterization, data
management, analysis and visualization. The data-related tools are
equally suited to analysis of experimental data, although that is not
the primary motivation for their development.

NeuroTools aims to:

#. increase the productivity of individual modellers by automating,
   simplifying, and establishing best-practices for common tasks,
#. increase the productivity of the neuroscience modelling community by
   reducing the amount of code duplication across simulation
   communities,
#. increase the reliability of data analysis tools leveraging `Linus's
   law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_enough_eyeballs>`_: "given
   enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

NeuroTools is open-source software, and anyone who is interested is
welcome to contribute
(`more <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools#Developerpages>`_).

Users' Guide
------------

NeuroTools functionality is modularized as follows:

-  The
   `signals <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/signals>`_
   module provides core functionality that allows manipulation of and
   calculations with spike trains and analog signals.
-  The `spike2 <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/spike2>`_
   module offers an easy way for reading data from CED's Spike2 Son
   files into the NeuroTools enviroment.
-  The
   `parameters <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/parameters>`_
   module contains classes to make managing large, hierarchical
   parameter sets easier.
-  The
   `analysis <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/analysis>`_
   module contains miscellaneous analysis functions
-  The `stgen <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/stgen>`_
   module contains various stochastic process generators relevant for
   Neuroscience (OU, poisson, inhomogenous gamma, ...).
-  The
   `utilities <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/utilities>`_
   sub-package contains``srblib``, an easy-to-use interface for
   interacting with `SRB <http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/index.php/Main_Page>`_
   servers.
-  The `io <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/io>`_ module
   is the gateway for all reading/writing of files, in different
   formats, in
   `NeuroTools <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/NeuroTools>`_.
-  The
   `plotting <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/plotting>`_
   module contains a collection of tools for plotting and image
   processing, based on Matplotlib and the Python Imaging Library.
-  The
   `datastore <http://neuralensemble.org/trac/NeuroTools/wiki/datastore>`_
   module presents a consistent interface for persistent data storage
   (e.g., for caching intermediate results), irrespective of storage
   back-end.
