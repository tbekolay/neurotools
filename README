NeuroTools
==========

NeuroTools is not a neural simulator, but rather a collection of tools
to support all tasks associated with a neural simulation project which
are not handled by the simulation engine. NeuroTools is written in
Python, and works best with PyNN, or one of the growing list of
simulation engines with a Python front-end such as NEURON, NEST,
PCSIM, FACETS Neuromorphic VLSI, Brian, MOOSE/GENESIS,
Neurospaces/GENESIS. NeuroTools provides modules to facilitate
simulation setup, parameterization and instrumentation, and data
management, analysis and visualization. The data-related tools are
equally suited to analysis of experimental data, although that is not
the primary motivation for their development.

NeuroTools aims to:

1. increase the productivity of individual modellers by automating,
   simplifying, and establishing best-practices for common tasks,

2. increase the productivity of the neuroscience modelling
   community by reducing the amount of code duplication across
   simulation communities, 

3. increase the reliability of data
   analysis tools leveraging Linus's law: "given enough eyeballs, all
   bugs are shallow."
