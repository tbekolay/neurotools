NeuroTools Installation
=======================

The simplest method is to use:

    $ pip install NeuroTools


Compiling from source
---------------------

First download the package files::

	$ svn co https://neuralensemble.org/svn/NeuroTools/trunk NeuroTools
	$ cd NeuroTools

Install as root (if you want a global install)::

	# python setup.py install

or for those without root access, install to a writable location, something like::

	$ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/opt/mystuff

Then you need to add the location::

    $HOME/opt/mystuff/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ 

to your PYTHONPATH or within python in your sys.path directive.

Note, here lib is replaced by `lib64` on 64 bit systems, and `python2.7` is
(obviously) replaced by your python version.

Developers of NeuroTools may be interested in using the last-updated version from svn.
A solution is to symbolically link the src folder to a folder included in the path::

	cd my_local_site-packages_folder
	ln -s where_I_check-out_neuralensemble/NeuroTools/trunk/src NeuroTools

and voila!
